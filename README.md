# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Analytics

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict credit card fraud using a comprehensive dataset obtained from Kaggle. The project is divided into two main phases: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML) Model Development. Through these phases, we seek to identify patterns and predictors of fraudulent transactions, ultimately developing a predictive model to accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Data Source
The dataset for this analysis is the "Credit Card Fraud Prediction" dataset available on Kaggle:
[Credit Card Fraud Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kelvinkelue/credit-card-fraud-prediction/data

It encompasses various features related to credit card transactions, including transaction details, merchant information, customer demographics, and a binary indicator of fraud.

## Objectives
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** To understand the dataset's characteristics, including the distribution of transactions over time, the prevalence of fraud across different categories, and geographical trends in fraudulent activities.
- **Machine Learning Model Development:** To apply machine learning algorithms to develop a robust model capable of predicting fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.

## Key Findings from EDA
- Fraudulent transactions, while rare, show distinct patterns that could potentially be leveraged for prediction.
- Certain transaction categories and geographical regions exhibit higher incidences of fraud.
- Temporal analysis reveals specific times when fraudulent activity peaks.
